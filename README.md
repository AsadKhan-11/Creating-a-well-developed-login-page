# Creating-a-well-developed-login-page
In this we will create a login page by just using HTML and CSS.
First of all we will a cover picture and make it's opacity and z-index low.
Then we will make a form for out inputs.
The inputs will be set as must required.
We will apply styling to the submit buttons and the form.
Now we will create a box same as the size of the form and apply backdrop filter to it. This will add a blurry affect to our form.
With all this our login page is ready. 
Enjoy!
